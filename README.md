# Firewall-ACL-Configuration-on-Router-Packet-Tracer-
This project demonstrates how to configure Access Control Lists (ACLs) on a router in Cisco Packet Tracer to create a firewall. The firewall restricts access to a server (e.g., Web Server) based on IP addresses and services. Only **PC1** is allowed access to the server, while all other devices are denied.
